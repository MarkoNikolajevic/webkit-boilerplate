# Web kit boilerplate

This is a boilerplate that I use for every web development project I am into.

To use it you must have installed Node and npm. Then you can clone this repository and run ``` npm install ``` to install all dependecies and plugins in your project folder.

### General information

The tools I use to make my work faster is:

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - Preprocessor for Css files
